sq80waveproc.m is a MATLAB/Octave script to read in single-cycle waveforms and automatically produce plots of their harmonic content. I wrote it with the intent of analyzing Ensoniq SQ80 waveforms, but it could of course be used for other things.

sq80waveplots.zip is a contains PDF files, one for each of the SQ80 waveforms, showing both the original time domain waveforms and plots of their spectral content.
